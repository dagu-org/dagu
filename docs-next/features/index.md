- Start/stop/restart patterns
- Skip redundant executions

### üöÄ [Execution Control](/features/execution-control)

Advanced execution patterns:

- Parallel execution with concurrency limits
- Conditional execution (preconditions)
- Continue on failure patterns
- Retry and repeat policies
- Output size management
- Signal handling

### üìä [Data Flow](/features/data-flow)

Managing data in workflows:

- Parameters and runtime values
- Output variables between steps
- Environment variable management
- JSON path references
- Template rendering
- Special system variables

### üìã [Queue System](/features/queues)

Workflow orchestration at scale:

- Built-in queue management
- Per-DAG queue assignment
- Priority-based execution
- Manual queue operations
- Concurrency control

### üìß [Notifications](/features/notifications)

Stay informed about workflow status:

- Email alerts on success/failure
- Custom notification handlers
- Log attachments
- Flexible SMTP configuration

## Feature Highlights

### Zero Dependencies

Unlike other workflow engines, Dagu requires:
- ‚ùå No database
- ‚ùå No message broker  
- ‚ùå No runtime dependencies
- ‚úÖ Just a single binary

### Language Agnostic

Run anything that works on your system:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: python
    command: python script.py
  - name: node
    command: npm run task
  - name: go
    command: go run main.go
  - name: bash
    command: ./script.sh
```

### Hierarchical Workflows

Build complex systems from simple parts:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: data-pipeline
    run: etl.yaml
    params: "DATE=today"
    
  - name: ml-training
    run: train.yaml
    depends: data-pipeline
    
  - name: deployment
    run: deploy.yaml
    depends: ml-training
```

### Production Ready

Built for reliability:

- **Process Management**: Proper signal handling and graceful shutdown
- **Error Recovery**: Configurable retry policies and failure handlers
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logs with stdout/stderr separation
- **Monitoring**: Built-in metrics and health checks

## Common Use Cases

### Data Engineering
- ETL pipelines with dependency management
- Parallel data processing
- Scheduled batch jobs
- Data quality checks

### DevOps Automation
- CI/CD pipelines
- Infrastructure provisioning
- Backup and restore workflows
- System maintenance tasks

### Business Process Automation
- Report generation
- Data synchronization
- Customer onboarding
- Invoice processing

## Performance Characteristics

### Scalability
- Handle thousands of concurrent workflows
- Efficient file-based storage
- Minimal memory footprint
- Fast startup times

### Limitations
- Single-machine execution (no distributed mode)
- 1MB default output limit per step
- 1000 item limit for parallel execution
- File system dependent

## Getting Started with Features

1. **Start with the basics**: Learn about [Interfaces](/overview/cli) to interact with Dagu
2. **Choose your executor**: Pick the right [Executor](/features/executors/shell) for your tasks
3. **Add scheduling**: Set up [automatic execution](/features/scheduling)
4. **Handle errors**: Implement proper [retry and error handling](/features/execution-control)
5. **Scale up**: Use [queues](/features/queues) for complex orchestration
