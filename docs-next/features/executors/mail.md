# Mail Executor

The mail executor enables you to send emails from your workflows, perfect for notifications, alerts, and report distribution.

## Overview

The mail executor allows you to:

- Send email notifications on workflow events
- Attach files and logs to emails
- Use templates with variable substitution
- Configure SMTP settings globally or per-step
- Send to multiple recipients
- Support HTML and plain text formats

## Basic Usage

### Simple Email

```yaml
smtp:
  host: "smtp.gmail.com"
  port: "587"
  username: "your-email@gmail.com"
  password: "your-app-password"

steps:
  - name: send-notification
    executor:
      type: mail
      config:
        to: recipient@example.com
        from: sender@example.com
        subject: "Workflow Completed"
        message: "The data processing workflow has completed successfully."
```

### With Multiple Recipients

```yaml
steps:
  - name: notify-team
    executor:
      type: mail
      config:
        to: "team@example.com, manager@example.com, alerts@example.com"
        from: noreply@example.com
        subject: "Daily Report Ready"
        message: "The daily report has been generated and is ready for review."
```

## SMTP Configuration

### Global SMTP Settings

Configure SMTP settings at the DAG level:

```yaml
smtp:
  host: "smtp.office365.com"
  port: "587"
  username: "${SMTP_USER}"
  password: "${SMTP_PASS}"

steps:
  - name: send-alert
    executor:
      type: mail
      config:
        to: alerts@company.com
        from: dagu@company.com
        subject: "Alert: Process Failed"
        message: "The data import process has failed. Please investigate."
```
