          Run ID: ${DAG_RUN_ID}
          Logs: ${DAG_RUN_LOG_FILE}
  
  failure:
    executor:
      type: mail
      config:
        to: oncall@company.com
        from: alerts@company.com
        subject: "❌ Pipeline Failed - ${DAG_NAME}"
        message: |
          Pipeline failed.
          Run ID: ${DAG_RUN_ID}
          Check logs: ${DAG_RUN_LOG_FILE}

```

## Common Patterns

### Conditional Alerts

```yaml
steps:
  - name: check-disk
    command: df -h /data | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | sed 's/%//'
    output: DISK_USAGE

  - name: alert-if-high
    executor:
      type: mail
      config:
        to: sysadmin@company.com
        from: monitoring@company.com
        subject: "⚠️ High Disk Usage"
        message: "Disk usage: ${DISK_USAGE}%"
    preconditions:
      - condition: "test ${DISK_USAGE} -gt 80"
```

### With Retry

```yaml
steps:
  - name: send-critical-alert
    executor:
      type: mail
      config:
        to: oncall@company.com
        from: alerts@company.com
        subject: "Critical Alert"
        message: "Immediate action required."
    retryPolicy:
      limit: 3
      intervalSec: 60
```
