- Signal handling

### üìä [Data Flow](/features/data-flow)

Managing data in workflows:

- Parameters and runtime values
- Output variables between steps
- Environment variable management
- JSON path references
- Template rendering
- Special system variables

### üìã [Queue System](/features/queues)

Workflow orchestration at scale:

- Built-in queue management
- Per-DAG queue assignment
- Priority-based execution
- Manual queue operations
- Concurrency control

### üìß [Notifications](/features/notifications)

Stay informed about workflow status:

- Email alerts on success/failure
- Custom notification handlers
- Log attachments
- Flexible SMTP configuration

### üîç [OpenTelemetry Tracing](/features/opentelemetry)

Distributed tracing for observability:

- End-to-end workflow visibility
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Nested DAG correlation
- Integration with Jaeger, Tempo, etc.

### [Distributed Execution](/features/distributed-execution)

Scale workflows across multiple machines:

- Coordinator-worker architecture
- Label-based task routing
- Real-time worker monitoring
- Requires shared storage for DAG files and state
- Horizontal scaling

### [Worker Labels](/features/worker-labels)

Task routing for distributed execution:

- Capability-based worker tagging
- Flexible label matching
- Resource optimization
- Geographic distribution
- Compliance requirements

## Feature Highlights

### Zero Dependencies

Unlike other workflow engines, Dagu requires:
- No database
- No message broker  
- No runtime dependencies
- Just a single binary

### Language Agnostic

Run anything that works on your system:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: python
    command: python script.py

  - name: node
    command: npm run task

  - name: go
    command: go run main.go

  - name: bash
    command: echo "Running script"
```

### Hierarchical Workflows

Build complex systems from simple parts:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: data-pipeline
    run: etl
    params: "DATE=today"
    
  - name: ml-training
    run: train
    parallel: "image text"
    params: "MODEL=latest TYPE=${ITEM}"
    
  - name: deployment
    run: deploy
    parallel: "staging production"
    params: "ENV=${ITEM}"

---
name: etl
params:
  - DATE: today
steps:
  - name: etl
    command: python etl.py

---
name: train
params:
  - MODEL: latest
  - TYPE: ""
steps:
  - name: train
    command: python train.py --model ${MODEL} --type ${TYPE}

---
name: deploy
params:
  - ENV: ""
steps:
  - name: deploy
    command: kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml --env ${ENV}
```
