<h1>Dagu</h1>

Dagu is a local-first workflow engine for operations and internal automation. It is open source and self-hostable: a single binary with a built-in Web UI, no external database or message broker, running on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Define [DAGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) in a declarative YAML format. It natively supports shell commands, Docker containers, Kubernetes Jobs, remote commands via SSH, and more through Dagu Actions.

Dagu turns existing scripts and runbooks into production workflows with scheduling, retries, human tasks, and run history. It runs where your data and credentials live: on-prem, air-gapped, edge, or cloud, and scales from a single node to a fleet of workers.

**Highlights:**

- Single binary installation.
- Self-contained: no external DBMS or message broker required.
- Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Declarative YAML format for defining DAGs.
- Run existing shell commands, Docker containers, Kubernetes Jobs, and remote commands over SSH without modifications.
- Compose reusable Sub-DAGs and run work in parallel with concurrency controls.
- Schedule workflows with cron syntax, timezones, overlap policies, and catch-up windows.
- Keep logs, run history, retries, notifications, and webhook triggers in one place.
- Built-in MCP server for inspecting workflows and runs, maintaining Wiki pages, applying changes, and controlling runs.

## Quick Look

For a quick look at how workflows are defined, see the examples.

## Why Dagu?

Orchestration is not your main work. You have scripts and containers that already work. You want a schedule, retries, dependencies, and a place to see logs. The usual options each have a cost:

- **cron** runs commands, but gives you no dependencies, no retries, no history.
- **Airflow** orchestrates, but you operate a platform for it (scheduler, metadata database, workers, a Python environment), and your jobs get rewritten as `@dag`/`@task` framework code.
- **Temporal** gives durable execution, but your business logic moves into its SDK and programming model.

You wanted to schedule some jobs. Now you operate a second system, and the orchestrator lives inside the code it was supposed to serve.

Dagu treats workflow structure as configuration, not code. Order, dependencies, retries, schedules, and human tasks go in one YAML file next to your scripts; the engine that runs them is a single process:

```sh
  Traditional Orchestrator          Dagu
  ┌────────────────────────┐        ┌──────────────────┐
  │  Web Server            │        │                  │
  │  Scheduler             │        │  dagu start-all  │
  │  Worker(s)             │        │                  │
  │  PostgreSQL            │        └──────────────────┘
  │  Redis / RabbitMQ      │         Single binary.
  │  Python Runtime        │         Self-hosted.
  └────────────────────────┘         Adds scheduling, retries, and human tasks around existing automation.
    6+ services to manage
```

Your scripts never import the orchestrator. Delete the YAML and they run exactly as before. Keep it, and every run gets a dependency graph, retries, per-step logs, history, and a Web UI.

## Performance

Dagu stores state in local files and reaches production throughput without external services.

- **Throughput:** A single machine can run thousands of workflow runs per day. Actual capacity depends on CPU, memory, disk, and workflow shape.
- **Load control:** Queues, concurrency limits, and resource limits control how many runs execute at once and where they run.
- **Scale out:** Workers spread execution across machines when one node is not enough.

## Real-World Use Cases

| Use Case | How Dagu Helps |
| --- | --- |
| ETL and data operations | Turn data extraction scripts, SQL queries, dbt commands, and data-processing runbooks into observable pipelines with durable execution. |
| Legacy scripts and scheduled jobs | Turn interdependent scripts into maintainable DAGs with a UI, automatic logging, retries, and notifications instead of opaque cron jobs. |
| Media conversion | Run `ffmpeg` for video transcoding and format conversion. File-backed state allows workers to run heavy conversions in parallel without single-machine bottlenecks or external databases. |
| Infrastructure and server automation | Run any command or script over SSH on remote servers, keeping logs, results, and notifications in one place. |
| GitHub-driven workflows | Trigger workflows from GitHub events to run automation on private infrastructure without exposing servers to the public internet. |
| Container and Kubernetes workflows | Run Docker containers and Kubernetes Jobs as steps in your workflows without building a custom control plane around containers. |
| Customer support automation | Provide self-service workflows that non-engineering teams can run for diagnostics, database queries, and routine operations without escalating to engineering. |
| IoT and edge workflows | Run sensor polling, local ML inference, data preprocessing, backups, offline sync, and health checks close to the data source with Web UI visibility. |

## Quick Start

### Install

**macOS/Linux:**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagucloud/dagu/main/scripts/installer.sh | bash
```

**Homebrew:**

```sh
brew install dagu
```

**npm:**

```sh
npm install -g --ignore-scripts=false @dagucloud/dagu
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagucloud/dagu/main/scripts/installer.ps1 | iex
```

**Docker:**

```sh
docker run --rm -v ~/.dagu:/var/lib/dagu -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/dagucloud/dagu:latest dagu start-all
```

> This command does not expose the host Docker daemon to Dagu. Workflows that
> use `container:` or `action: docker.run` need the
> [container-step Docker setup](https://docs.dagu.sh/getting-started/installation/docker#run-container-steps-when-dagu-runs-in-docker).
> Mounting the Docker socket grants workflows control of the host daemon.

**Kubernetes (Helm):**

```sh
helm repo add dagu https://dagucloud.github.io/dagu
helm repo update
helm install dagu dagu/dagu --set persistence.storageClass=<your-rwx-storage-class>
```

> Replace `<your-rwx-storage-class>` with a StorageClass that supports `ReadWriteMany`. See [charts/dagu/README.md](./charts/dagu/README.md) for chart configuration.

The script installers run a guided wizard that can add Dagu to your PATH, set it up as a background service, and create the initial admin account. Homebrew, npm, Docker, and Helm install without the wizard. See the [Installation documentation](https://docs.dagu.sh/getting-started/installation/) for all options.

### Create and run a workflow

Create `hello.yaml`:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: hello
    run: echo "hello from Dagu"
```

Run the workflow with:

```sh
dagu start hello.yaml
```

### Start the server

```sh
dagu start-all --dags .
```

Visit http://localhost:8080

## How You Run Dagu

Dagu runs on one machine, on temporary workers your platform creates for each run, or on workers you keep running. All three are self-hosted, and the same workflow YAML runs on any of them. See the [Deployment Models guide](https://docs.dagu.sh/overview/deployment-models).

| Topology | Execution | Best for |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Single server** | `dagu start-all` runs the server, scheduler, and steps in one process on one machine. | Development, single-machine scheduled workloads, edge jobs, and internal automation. |
| **Temporary workers** | Cloud Run Jobs, Kubernetes Jobs, or CI provision a worker per run that invokes the binary and is destroyed when the run ends. The server reads run state from a shared volume. | Ephemeral compute, capacity that falls to zero between jobs, and launchers you already operate. |
| **Distributed workers** | Workers you keep running poll a coordinator over gRPC and are routed work by label. | Docker and private-network steps, warm toolchains, and multiple execution hosts. |

### Licensing

- **Community self-host:** No license key required. You operate the server, storage, upgrades, networking, and workers. Start with the [installation guide](https://docs.dagu.sh/getting-started/installation/).
- **Self-host license:** Adds SSO, RBAC, audit logging, and incident SaaS integration to Dagu. See [self-host licensing](https://dagu.sh/pricing#self-host).

## Key Features

- **Observability:** Shared workflows and scheduling with clear visualizations, status tracking, and logs in the Web UI.
- **Language-agnostic:** No framework required. Define workflow steps using shell commands, Docker containers, Kubernetes Jobs, SQL queries, HTTP requests, and any other tool via official and third-party Dagu Actions.
- **Build workflows:** Reuse a step's result when its command and files have not changed. Dagu can also infer dependencies from matching file paths.
- **Reproducibility:** Reproducible runs with pinned tools, plus automatic installation and caching on workers, eliminating the need to manually install dependencies on the server or workers.
- **Human Tasks:** Pause a workflow for acknowledgement or typed operator input, then expose the response to downstream steps.
- **Secret management:** Built-in secret management with secure log masking, preventing credentials from leaking into logs or the Web UI.
- **Self-hosted:** A single binary that runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Execution scales out to a fleet of workers.
- **Permission Control:** RBAC and SSO support for team environments, controlling who can view, run, and edit workflows through granular permissions and audit logging.
- **MCP Server:** Authenticated MCP clients can inspect workflows and runs, maintain Wiki pages, apply changes, and control runs.

## Architecture

One binary carries every role. Which roles you start, and where, is what the [deployment models](#how-you-run-dagu) differ on.

- **Server** serves the Web UI and REST API.
- **Scheduler** owns `schedule:` and drains the queue.
- **Coordinator** is the gRPC endpoint workers poll. It also persists what they report: run status, streamed logs, and artifacts.
- **Worker** polls a coordinator, executes dispatched runs locally, and reports back. Routed by labels.
- `dagu start-all` runs the server, scheduler, and coordinator in one process.

Set `DAGU_HEADLESS=true` to run without the Web UI, which applies to any of the topologies and suits CI or CLI-only environments.

## Parameter Definition

Workflows can define parameters that render as typed input forms in the Web UI and can be referenced by steps.

```yaml
params:
  - name: customer_id
    type: string
    description: Customer or account identifier
  - name: change_scope
    type: string
    description: What the repair is allowed to change
    enum:
      - metadata_only
      - permissions
      - full_account
    default: metadata_only
  - name: dry_run
    type: boolean
    default: true

steps:
  - id: extract
    run: >-
      ./scripts/extract.sh
      --customer "${params.customer_id}"
      --scope "${params.change_scope}"
      --dry-run="${params.dry_run}"
    retry_policy:
      limit: 3
      interval_sec: 30
```

## Workflow Examples

### Docker step

When Dagu itself runs in Docker, enable
[Docker daemon access](https://docs.dagu.sh/getting-started/installation/docker#run-container-steps-when-dagu-runs-in-docker)
before using container steps.

Pass standard `docker run` options directly in YAML, including the image, pull policy, platform, volume mounts, working directory, and resource limits:

```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 512Mi

steps:
  - id: report
    action: docker.run
    with:
      image: ghcr.io/acme/reporting:1.4.2
      pull: always
      platform: linux/amd64
      working_dir: /work
      volumes:
        - ~/orders:/work/data
      auto_remove: true
      command: python generate_report.py --input /work/data/orders.csv
```

See the [Docker](https://docs.dagu.sh/step-types/docker) and [DAG Run Resource Limits](https://docs.dagu.sh/writing-workflows/dag-run-resource-limits) documentation for all configuration options.

### Parallel Sub-DAG execution

The parent invokes the same child DAG for multiple targets and limits concurrent child runs:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: patch
    action: dag.run
    with:
      dag: patch-host
      params:
        host: ${ITEM}
    parallel:
      items:
        - web-1.internal
        - web-2.internal
        - db-1.internal
      max_concurrent: 2

---

name: patch-host
params:
  - name: host
    type: string
ssh:
  user: deploy
  host: ${params.host}
steps:
  - id: apply
    run: apt-get update -q && apt-get upgrade -y
```

See the [Sub-DAGs](https://docs.dagu.sh/writing-workflows/sub-dags) documentation for parameter passing and fan-out options.

### SSH remote execution

```yaml
ssh:
  user: deploy
  host: web-1.internal
  key: ~/.ssh/deploy_key

steps:
  - id: health
    run: curl -f http://localhost:8080/health
    retry_policy:
      limit: 3
      interval_sec: 10

  - id: restart
    run: systemctl restart myapp
    depends: health
```

See the [SSH](https://docs.dagu.sh/step-types/ssh) documentation for authentication and connection options.

### Scheduling with overlap control and catch-up

```yaml
schedule:
  - "0 */6 * * *"          # Every 6 hours
overlap_policy: skip       # Skip if previous run is still active
catchup_window: "5h"       # Catch up missed runs when scheduler is down for up to 5 hours

timeout_sec: 3600
handler_on:
  failure:
    run: notify-team.sh
  exit:
    run: cleanup.sh
```

See the [Scheduling](https://docs.dagu.sh/writing-workflows/scheduling) and [Lifecycle Handlers](https://docs.dagu.sh/writing-workflows/lifecycle-handlers) documentation for all options.

### Retry and error handling

```yaml
steps:
  - name: flaky-api-call
    run: curl -f https://api.example.com/data
    retry_policy:
      limit: 3
      interval_sec: 10
    continue_on:
      failure: true
```

See the [Durable Execution](https://docs.dagu.sh/writing-workflows/durable-execution) and [Continue On](https://docs.dagu.sh/writing-workflows/continue-on) documentation for retry policies and failure handling.

## More Workflow Examples

### Parallel executions

```yaml
steps:
  - id: extract
    run: ./extract.sh

  - id: transform_a
    run: ./transform_a.sh
    depends: extract

  - id: transform_b
    run: ./transform_b.sh
    depends: extract

  - id: load
    run: ./load.sh
    depends: [transform_a, transform_b]
```

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'base', 'themeVariables': {'background': '#18181B', 'primaryTextColor': '#fff', 'lineColor': '#888'}}}%%
graph LR
    A[extract] --> B[transform_a]
    A --> C[transform_b]
    B --> D[load]
    C --> D
    style A fill:#18181B,stroke:#22C55E,stroke-width:1.6px,color:#fff
    style B fill:#18181B,stroke:#22C55E,stroke-width:1.6px,color:#fff
    style C fill:#18181B,stroke:#22C55E,stroke-width:1.6px,color:#fff
    style D fill:#18181B,stroke:#3B82F6,stroke-width:1.6px,color:#fff
```

See the [Control Flow](https://docs.dagu.sh/writing-workflows/control-flow) documentation for dependencies, conditions, and repetition.

### Reuse unchanged results

Save this as `workflow.yaml`:

```yaml
type: build
working_dir: .

steps:
  - id: uppercase
    inputs:
      - name: source
        path: source.txt
    outputs:
      - name: result
        path: uppercase.txt
    run: |
      #!/bin/sh
      tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' < "${inputs.source}" > "${outputs.result}"
```

Run it:

```sh
printf 'alpha\n' > source.txt
dagu start workflow.yaml
```

Run `dagu start workflow.yaml` again and Dagu reuses `uppercase.txt`. Change `source.txt` and the step runs again. `${outputs.result}` is a temporary path that Dagu publishes as `uppercase.txt` after the command succeeds.

Build workflows currently run locally. See [Build Workflows](https://docs.dagu.sh/writing-workflows/incremental-workflows) for dependency inference and reuse rules.

### External tools with pinning and caching

```yaml
tools:
  - jqlang/jq@jq-1.7.1

steps:
  - id: inspect
    run: jq --version

  - id: summarize
    action: python-script@v1
    with:
      input:
        rows: [42, 8]
      script: |
        return {"total": sum(input["rows"])}
```

Dagu installs declared portable CLIs before the DAG run, exposes them on `PATH` for host command steps, and caches them on each worker. Tool provisioning uses [aqua](https://aquaproj.github.io/) as the default provider; the standard registry resolves to the latest aqua-registry release automatically. Pin a specific artifact with `package@version#sha256:<hex>` when the release tag alone is not a strong enough guarantee. See the [Tools documentation](https://docs.dagu.sh/writing-workflows/tools) and [Dagu Actions](https://docs.dagu.sh/dagu-actions/) for more details.

### Third-party Dagu Actions

```yaml
params:
  - BUILD_ID

steps:
  - id: notify
    action: acme/dagu-action-notify@v1.2.0
    with:
      text: "Build ${params.BUILD_ID} finished"

  - id: audit
    depends: notify
    run: 'echo "Notification result: ${steps.notify.outputs.messageId}"'
```

A third-party Dagu Action package contains a DAG, manifest, schemas, and helper files behind an `action:` reference. See the [Dagu Actions](https://docs.dagu.sh/dagu-actions/) and [Third-Party Actions](https://docs.dagu.sh/dagu-actions/third-party) documentation for details.

### Kubernetes Pod execution

```yaml
steps:
  - name: batch-job
    action: kubernetes.run
    with:
      namespace: production
      image: my-registry/batch-processor:latest
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "2"
          memory: "4Gi"
      command: ./process.sh
```

See the [Kubernetes](https://docs.dagu.sh/step-types/kubernetes) documentation for Job configuration options.

For more examples, see the [Examples documentation](https://docs.dagu.sh/writing-workflows/examples).

## MCP

Dagu includes a built-in MCP server at `http://localhost:8080/mcp`. MCP clients can inspect workflows and run state, maintain Dagu's built-in Wiki pages, preview and apply DAG or Wiki page changes, and control runs through the same authenticated server boundary as the REST API.

See the [MCP overview](https://docs.dagu.sh/mcp/) and [quickstart](https://docs.dagu.sh/mcp/quickstart).

## Built-in Actions

Dagu includes built-in actions that run within the Dagu process or on the selected worker. Local shell commands use the `run:` field; structured work uses `action:`.

| Action | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `run:` field | Local shell commands and scripts (bash, sh, PowerShell, custom shells) |
| `exec` | Direct process execution without shell parsing |
| `noop` | Output-only or approval-only placeholder step |
| `log.write` | Write structured log messages |
| `docker.run` / `container.run` | Run containers with registry auth, volume mounts, and resource limits |

## Custom Actions

Custom Actions are inline reusable wrappers defined with the top-level `actions` field. They expand to built-in actions during DAG load, so you can wrap a common shell, HTTP, SQL, or other pattern behind a typed interface with validated input.

```yaml
actions:
  webhook.send:
    input_schema:
      type: object
      additionalProperties: false
      required: [url, text]
      properties:
        url:
          type: string
        text:
          type: string
    template:
      action: http.request
      with:
        method: POST
        url: '{{ .input.url }}'
        headers:
          Content-Type: application/json
        body: |
          {"text": {{ json .input.text }}}

steps:
  - action: webhook.send
    with:
      url: https://hooks.example.com/ops
      text: deploy complete
```

See [Custom Actions](https://docs.dagu.sh/dagu-actions/custom) and the [YAML Specification](https://docs.dagu.sh/writing-workflows/yaml-specification) for the exact `actions`, `action`, and `run` field behavior.

## Official Dagu Actions

Dagu Actions are official action packages maintained in the `dagucloud` GitHub organization. They use the same action package runtime as third-party action packages, but callers use the short form `action: name@version`.

| Dagu Action | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `node-script@v1` | Run small JavaScript transforms or glue code with action-owned Node.js |
| `python-script@v1` | Run small Python transforms or glue code with action-owned Python and optional requirements |
| `dbt@v1` | Run dbt Core commands with action-owned Python and adapter requirements |
| `duckdb@v1` | Run DuckDB SQL through the DuckDB CLI without adding DuckDB to the core binary |
| `ffmpeg@v1` | Run FFmpeg conversion, transcoding, probing, and stream-processing tasks |
| `github-cli@v1` | Run GitHub issue, pull request, release, repository, and API automation through `gh` |
| `rclone@v1` | Run portable copy, sync, check, list, and storage-management workflows through rclone |

Versions are required. Pin production workflows to a version tag or commit SHA. See [Official Dagu Actions](https://docs.dagu.sh/dagu-actions/official) for the current Dagu Action list and exact input/output contracts.

For non-official packages, use [Third-Party Actions](https://docs.dagu.sh/dagu-actions/third-party) such as `action: owner/repo@version`. They contain a `dagu-action.yaml` manifest and a DAG entrypoint, run as sub-DAGs, and are transferred to distributed workers as workspace bundles after the reference is resolved. See the documentation for package layout and reference formats.

## Security and Access Control

### Authentication

Dagu supports three top-level authentication modes, configured via `DAGU_AUTH_MODE`:

- **`none`**: No authentication
- **`basic`**: HTTP Basic authentication
- **`builtin`**: JWT-based authentication with user management, API keys, per-DAG webhook tokens, and optional OIDC/SSO integration

### Role-Based Access Control

When using `builtin` auth, five roles control access:

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| `admin` | Full access including user management |
| `manager` | Create, edit, delete, run, stop DAGs; view audit logs |
| `developer` | Create, edit, delete, run, stop DAGs |
| `operator` | Run and stop DAGs only (no editing) |
| `viewer` | Read-only access |

API keys can be created with independent role assignments. Audit logging tracks all actions.

### TLS and Secrets

- TLS for the HTTP server (`DAGU_CERT_FILE`, `DAGU_KEY_FILE`)
- Mutual TLS for gRPC coordinator/worker communication (`DAGU_PEER_CERT_FILE`, `DAGU_PEER_KEY_FILE`, `DAGU_PEER_CLIENT_CA_FILE`)
- Secret management with environment variables, files, Kubernetes Secrets, [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), and cloud-provider secret stores

### Production Hardening

For self-hosted production deployments, treat network exposure and execution boundaries as the primary controls:

- Prefer `auth.mode: builtin` for any shared or network-exposed instance. Use `basic` only for simple private setups, and avoid `none` outside isolated local development.
- Keep `metrics: private` unless the metrics endpoint is reachable only on a trusted private network.
- Bind Dagu to loopback or a private interface when possible. If you must use `0.0.0.0`, place it behind a trusted reverse proxy, TLS, and network-level access controls.
- Leave `terminal.enabled: false` unless the instance is admin-only and tightly scoped.
- In distributed deployments, set `peer.insecure=false` and configure peer TLS when coordinator and workers communicate across host or network boundaries.
- Treat Docker socket mounts, root containers, and host-level executors as privileged access to the underlying machine.

See [Server Configuration](https://docs.dagu.sh/server-admin/configuration), [Docker deployment](https://docs.dagu.sh/server-admin/deployment/docker), and [Distributed execution](https://docs.dagu.sh/server-admin/distributed/) for operator-focused guidance.

## Observability

### Prometheus Metrics

Dagu exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics:

- `dagu_info`: Build information (version, Go version)
- `dagu_uptime_seconds`: Server uptime
- `dagu_dag_runs_total`: Total DAG runs by status
- `dagu_dag_runs_total_by_dag`: Per-DAG run counts
- `dagu_dag_run_duration_seconds`: Histogram of run durations
- `dagu_dag_runs_currently_running`: Active DAG runs
- `dagu_dag_runs_queued_total`: Queued runs
- `dagu_workers_registered`: Registered distributed workers
- `dagu_worker_info`: Worker heartbeat labels as key/value metadata
- `dagu_worker_heartbeat_timestamp_seconds`: Last worker heartbeat timestamp
- `dagu_worker_health_status`: Worker health by heartbeat freshness
- `dagu_worker_pollers`: Worker poller capacity by state
- `dagu_worker_running_tasks`: Running tasks per worker
- `dagu_worker_oldest_running_task_age_seconds`: Age of the oldest running task per worker

### Structured Logging

JSON or text format logging (`DAGU_LOG_FORMAT`). Logs are stored per-run with separate stdout/stderr capture per step.

### Notifications

- Email notifications on DAG success, failure, or wait status via SMTP
- Per-DAG webhook endpoints with token authentication
- Delivery requires the event store, notification store, and writable notification state store

Scoped notification routing is broken in v2.11.0-v2.11.2. Use v2.11.3 or later.

## Artifacts

![Artifact browser in dark mode](./assets/images/readme-artifacts-dark.png)

Dagu runs can write arbitrary files under `${context.paths.artifacts_dir}` in value-resolved fields, with `DAG_RUN_ARTIFACTS_DIR` also exposed to step processes. Dagu stores those files per run as Artifacts. In the Web UI, operators can browse the file tree, preview Markdown, text, and image files inline, and download any artifact when they need the raw file.

This is useful for generated reports, screenshots, charts, exported JSON or CSV files, and other outputs that do not fit simple key/value outputs.

See the [Artifacts documentation](https://docs.dagu.sh/writing-workflows/artifacts) and the [Web UI guide](https://docs.dagu.sh/overview/web-ui) for the full artifact browser workflow and screenshots.

## Scheduling and Reliability

- **Cron scheduling** with timezone support and multiple schedule entries per DAG
- **Overlap policies**: `skip` (default: skip if previous run is still active), `all` (queue all), `latest` (keep only the most recent)
- **Catch-up scheduling**: Automatically runs missed intervals when the scheduler was down
- **Zombie detection**: Identifies and handles stalled DAG runs (configurable interval, default 45s)
- **Retry policies**: Per-step retry with configurable limits, intervals, and exit code filtering
- **Human tasks**: Pause root DAG runs for acknowledgement or schema-validated operator input, locally or on distributed workers, then expose form values to downstream steps
- **Lifecycle hooks**: `onInit`, `onSuccess`, `onFailure`, `onAbort`, `onExit`, `onWait`
- **Preconditions**: Gate DAG or step execution on shell command results
- **High availability**: Scheduler lock with stale detection for failover

## Distributed Execution

Operational detail for the [distributed workers](#how-you-run-dagu) topology:

- **Coordinator**: gRPC server that manages task distribution, worker registry, and health monitoring
- **Workers**: Poll the coordinator outbound, execute DAGs locally, and report status, logs, and artifacts back. No inbound port required
- **Worker labels**: Route DAGs to specific workers based on labels (e.g., `gpu=true`, `region=us-east-1`)
- **Health checks**: HTTP health endpoints on coordinator and workers for load balancer integration
- **Queue system**: File-based persistent queue with configurable concurrency limits

```sh
# Start coordinator
dagu coordinator --coordinator.host=0.0.0.0 --coordinator.advertise=coordinator.internal

# Start workers (on separate machines)
DAGU_WORKER_COORDINATORS=coordinator.internal:50055 \
  DAGU_WORKER_LABELS=gpu=true,memory=64G dagu worker
```

See the [distributed execution documentation](https://docs.dagu.sh/server-admin/distributed/) for setup details.

## Environment Variables

**Precedence:** Command-line flags > Environment variables > Configuration file (`~/.config/dagu/config.yaml`)

### Server

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DAGU_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address |
| `DAGU_PORT` | `8080` | HTTP port |
| `DAGU_BASE_PATH` | - | Base path for reverse proxy |
| `DAGU_HEADLESS` | `false` | Run without web UI |
| `DAGU_TZ` | - | Timezone (e.g., `Asia/Tokyo`) |
| `DAGU_LOG_FORMAT` | `text` | `text` or `json` |
| `DAGU_CERT_FILE` | - | TLS certificate |
| `DAGU_KEY_FILE` | - | TLS private key |
| `DAGU_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | - | Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins (e.g. `https://app.example.com`). When unset, cross-origin browser access is disabled. Exact origins enable credentials. An explicit `*` allows every origin without credentials and emits a security warning. |
| `DAGU_IP_ACCESS_ALLOWED_IPS` | - | Comma-separated IPv4/IPv6 addresses and CIDR ranges allowed to access the HTTP server. Empty disables filtering. |
| `DAGU_IP_ACCESS_TRUSTED_PROXIES` | - | Comma-separated proxy addresses and CIDR ranges permitted to supply forwarded client IP headers. |
| `DAGU_PUBLIC_URL` | - | External Web UI URL used in generated links, including notification and incident DAG-run links |
| `DAGU_SERVER_METRICS` | `private` | Metrics endpoint access: `private` or `public` |
| `DAGU_TERMINAL_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable the web-based terminal |
| `DAGU_DEFAULT_SHELL` | `$SHELL`, then `sh` | Default shell for command steps |
| `DAGU_ENV_PASSTHROUGH_PREFIXES` | - | Comma-separated env var prefixes forwarded to step execution |
| `DAGU_DEBUG` | - | Enable debug mode |

The equivalent YAML protects every HTTP route, including health, metrics,
webhooks, SSE, terminal, and MCP:

```yaml
ip_access:
  allowed_ips:
    - 203.0.113.10
    - 10.0.0.0/8
  trusted_proxies:
    - 127.0.0.1
    - 10.42.0.0/16
```

Forwarded addresses are used only when the direct peer matches
`trusted_proxies`. The proxy must remove client-supplied forwarding headers and
set or append the verified client address. Keep trusted proxy ranges narrow.

### Paths

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DAGU_HOME` | - | Overrides all path defaults |
| `DAGU_DAGS_DIR` | `~/.config/dagu/dags` | DAG definitions directory |
| `DAGU_DAG_DISCOVERY_RECURSIVE` | `false` | Discover DAGs in subdirectories |
| `DAGU_DAG_DISCOVERY_SYMLINKS` | `false` | Include recursive file symlinks and allow external targets |
| `DAGU_LOG_DIR` | `~/.local/share/dagu/logs` | Log files |
| `DAGU_DATA_DIR` | `~/.local/share/dagu/data` | Application state |
| `DAGU_TOOLS_DIR` | `{DAGU_DATA_DIR}/tools` | Managed DAG tool cache |
| `DAGU_DAG_STATE_DIR` | `{DAGU_DATA_DIR}/dag-state` | Persistent DAG state files |
| `DAGU_DAG_RUN_WORK_DIR` | `{DAGU_DATA_DIR}/dag-run-work` | Per-run working directories |
| `DAGU_BASE_CONFIG` | - | Shared base configuration applied to all DAGs |

Set the per-run work root in `config.yaml`, or use the corresponding environment variable above:

```yaml
paths:
  dag_run_work_dir: /mnt/dagu/dag-run-work
```

`DAGU_DAG_RUN_WORK_DIR` configures this root for Dagu processes. Workflow code should use the runtime `DAG_RUN_WORK_DIR` variable for its assigned per-run directory instead of constructing paths under DAG-run history.

Processes sharing DAG runs must use the same work root.

Backups that select individual data subdirectories must include both `paths.dag_runs_dir` and `paths.dag_run_work_dir`. A backup of the complete `paths.data_dir` includes both default locations. The Helm chart's default `/data/dag-run-work` path uses its existing `/data` volume and does not need an additional volume.

When upgrading a deployment whose processes share a durable work root, do not let old and new Dagu versions execute the same run concurrently: drain or stop the processes, upgrade them together, and then resume execution. Mixed-version processes can otherwise choose the old nested directory and the new separate directory for one run.

Recursive discovery can also be enabled in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
dag_discovery:
  recursive: true
```

It scans `paths.dags_dir`, excluding `workspaces/`, dot-directories, and symlinks. File stems and effective DAG names must each be unique, using case-sensitive comparison; conflicting files are excluded until the conflict is resolved. `paths.alt_dags_dir` remains lookup-only.

Set `dag_discovery.symlinks: true` (or
`DAGU_DAG_DISCOVERY_SYMLINKS=true`) to include YAML file symlinks in recursive
discovery and to allow YAML file symlinks whose targets are outside
`paths.dags_dir`. Symlinked directories are never traversed. External targets
can be viewed, scheduled, and run, but cannot be updated, deleted, or renamed
through Dagu. Without the opt-in, top-level YAML file symlinks whose targets
remain inside `paths.dags_dir` continue to work. A symlink configured as
`paths.dags_dir` itself is also supported.

### Authentication

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DAGU_AUTH_MODE` | `builtin` | `none`, `basic`, or `builtin` |
| `DAGU_AUTH_BASIC_USERNAME` | - | Basic auth username |
| `DAGU_AUTH_BASIC_PASSWORD` | - | Basic auth password |
| `DAGU_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` | (auto) | JWT signing secret |
| `DAGU_AUTH_TOKEN_TTL` | `24h` | JWT token lifetime (maximum: `8760h` / 365 days) |
| `DAGU_AUTH_BUILTIN_INITIAL_ADMIN_USERNAME` | - | Auto-provision the first admin on startup (requires the password variable) |
| `DAGU_AUTH_BUILTIN_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | - | Password for the auto-provisioned admin (minimum 8 characters) |
| `DAGU_LICENSE_KEY` | - | License key for licensed self-host features |

OIDC variables: `DAGU_AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `DAGU_AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, `DAGU_AUTH_OIDC_ISSUER`, `DAGU_AUTH_OIDC_SCOPES`, `DAGU_AUTH_OIDC_WHITELIST`, `DAGU_AUTH_OIDC_AUTO_SIGNUP`, `DAGU_AUTH_OIDC_DEFAULT_ROLE`, `DAGU_AUTH_OIDC_ALLOWED_DOMAINS`.

### Scheduler

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DAGU_SCHEDULER_PORT` | `8090` | Health check port |
| `DAGU_SCHEDULER_ZOMBIE_DETECTION_INTERVAL` | `45s` | Zombie run detection interval (`0` to disable) |
| `DAGU_SCHEDULER_LOCK_STALE_THRESHOLD` | `30s` | HA lock stale threshold |
| `DAGU_QUEUE_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable queue system |

### Coordinator / Worker

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DAGU_COORDINATOR_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Coordinator bind address |
| `DAGU_COORDINATOR_PORT` | `50055` | Coordinator gRPC port |
| `DAGU_COORDINATOR_HEALTH_PORT` | `8091` | Coordinator health check port |
| `DAGU_WORKER_ID` | - | Worker instance ID |
| `DAGU_WORKER_MAX_ACTIVE_RUNS` | `100` | Max concurrent runs per worker |
| `DAGU_WORKER_HEALTH_PORT` | `8092` | Worker health check port |
| `DAGU_WORKER_LABELS` | - | Worker labels (`key=value,key=value`); `os` and `arch` are built in and cannot be overridden |
| `DAGU_COORDINATOR_ADVERTISE` | auto-detected hostname | Address advertised in the service registry |
| `DAGU_WORKER_COORDINATORS` | - | Coordinator addresses required by `dagu worker` (`host:port,...`) |

### Peer TLS (gRPC)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DAGU_PEER_CERT_FILE` | - | Peer TLS certificate |
| `DAGU_PEER_KEY_FILE` | - | Peer TLS private key |
| `DAGU_PEER_CLIENT_CA_FILE` | - | CA for client verification |
| `DAGU_PEER_INSECURE` | `true` | Use h2c instead of TLS |
| `DAGU_PEER_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY` | - | Skip TLS certificate verification |

### Git Sync

Git Sync copies Git-tracked supporting files into the DAGs directory. Workflow and Wiki files retain their existing handling; supporting file IDs include their extension and preserve the executable bit. On Windows, Git Sync retains the repository mode when publishing because local execute-bit changes cannot be detected.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DAGU_GITSYNC_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable Git sync |
| `DAGU_GITSYNC_REPOSITORY` | - | Repository URL |
| `DAGU_GITSYNC_BRANCH` | `main` | Branch to sync |
| `DAGU_GITSYNC_AUTH_TYPE` | `token` | `token` or `ssh` |
| `DAGU_GITSYNC_AUTH_TOKEN` | - | Personal access token for HTTPS auth |
| `DAGU_GITSYNC_AUTH_SSH_KEY_PATH` | - | Path to the SSH private key |
| `DAGU_GITSYNC_AUTOSYNC_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable periodic auto-pull |
| `DAGU_GITSYNC_AUTOSYNC_INTERVAL` | `300` | Sync interval in seconds |

These tables cover the variables most deployments touch. The full reference lists about 180 `DAGU_*` variables, including SSE, tunnel, UI, monitoring, audit, and secret-provider settings: see the [configuration reference](https://docs.dagu.sh/server-admin/reference).

## Embedded Go API (Experimental)

Go applications can import Dagu and start DAG runs from the host process:

```go
import "github.com/dagucloud/dagu/v2"
```

```go
engine, err := dagu.New(ctx, dagu.Options{
	HomeDir: "/var/lib/myapp/dagu",
})
if err != nil {
	return err
}
defer engine.Close(context.Background())

run, err := engine.RunYAML(ctx, []byte(`
params:
  - MESSAGE
steps:
  - name: hello
    run: echo "${params.MESSAGE}"
`), dagu.WithParams(map[string]string{
	"MESSAGE": "hello from the host app",
}))
if err != nil {
	return err
}

status, err := run.Wait(ctx)
if err != nil {
	return err
}
fmt.Println(status.Status)
```

The embedded API is experimental and may change. See the [embedded API documentation](https://docs.dagu.sh/embedding/go-api) and [examples/embedded](./examples/embedded).
