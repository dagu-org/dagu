# Overview - Orchestrate workflows without complexity

**Dagu** */dah-goo/* is a powerful workflow engine designed to be deployable in environments where Airflow cannot be installed, such as small devices, on-premise servers, and legacy systems. It allows you to declaratively define any batch job as a single DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) in a simple YAML format.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: step1
    command: sleep 1 && echo "Hello, Dagu!"
    
  - name: step2
    command: sleep 1 && echo "This is a second step"
```

By declaratively defining the processes within a job, complex workflows become visualized, making troubleshooting and recovery easier. Viewing log and retry can be performed from the Web UI, eliminating the need to manually log into a server via SSH.

It is equipped with many features to meet the highly detailed requirements of enterprise environments. It operates even in environments without internet access and, being statically compiled, includes all dependencies, allowing it to be used in any environment, including on-premise, cloud, and IoT devices. It is a lightweight workflow engine that meets enterprise requirements.

Note: For a list of features, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.dagu.cloud/features/).

Workflow jobs are defined as commands. Therefore, legacy scripts that have been in operation for a long time within a company or organization can be used as-is without modification. There is no need to learn a complex new language, and you can start using it right away.

Dagu is designed for small teams of 1-3 people to easily manage complex workflows. It aims to be an ideal choice for teams that find large-scale, high-cost infrastructure like Airflow to be overkill and are looking for a simpler solution. It requires no database management and only needs a shared filesystem, allowing you to focus on your high-value work.

## Demo

- **OpenTelemetry Support (OTEL)**: Distributed tracing with W3C trace context propagation (requested by [@jeremydelattre59](https://github.com/jeremydelattre59))
- **Windows Support (Beta)**: Initial PowerShell and cmd.exe compatibility - basic functionality works but may have limitations ([@pdoronila](https://github.com/pdoronila))
- **Hierarchical DAG**: Nested workflows with parameter passing
- **Individual Step Retry**: Retry individual steps without re-running entire workflow ([@thefishhat](https://github.com/thefishhat))
- **Repeat Policy Enhancement**: The 'while'/'until' modes are added to repeat policy setting ([@thefishhat](https://github.com/thefishhat))
- **Queueing functionality**: Enqueue DAGs without running immediately to limit resource usage of the workflow ([@kriyanshii](https://github.com/kriyanshii))

## Use Cases

Dagu is designed to orchestrate workflows across various domains, particularly those involving multi-step batch jobs and complex data dependencies. Example applications include:

* AI/ML & Data Science - Automating machine learning workflows, including data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, validation, and deployment.
* Geospatial & Environmental Analysis - Processing datasets from sources such as satellites (earth observation), aerial/terrestrial sensors, seismic surveys, and ground-based radar. Common uses include numerical weather prediction and natural resource management.
* Finance & Trading - Implementing time-sensitive workflows for stock market analysis, quantitative modeling, risk assessment, and report generation.
* Medical Imaging & Bioinformatics - Creating pipelines to process and analyze large volumes of medical scans (e.g., MRI, CT) or genomic data for clinical and research purposes.
* Data Engineering (ETL/ELT) - Building, scheduling, and monitoring pipelines for moving and transforming data between systems like databases, data warehouses, and data lakes.
* IoT & Edge Computing - Orchestrating workflows that collect, process, and analyze data from distributed IoT devices, sensors, and edge nodes.
* Media & Content Processing - Automating workflows for video transcoding, image processing, and content delivery, including tasks like format conversion, compression, and metadata extraction.
