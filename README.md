# Overview - Workflow Engine for Small Teams

Dagu */dah-goo/* is a compact, portable workflow engine implemented in Go. It provides a declarative model for orchestrating command execution across diverse environments, including shell scripts, Python commands, containerized operations, or remote commands.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: step1
    command: sleep 1 && echo "Hello, dagu!"
  - name: step2
    command: sleep 1 && echo "This is a second step"
```

By declaratively defining job processes, complex workflows can be visualized, making troubleshooting and recovery easier. Viewing logs and retrying jobs can be performed from the Web UI, eliminating the need to log into a server via SSH.

It is equipped with many features to meet the detailed requirements of enterprise environments. It operates even in environments without internet access. Being a statically compiled binary, it includes all dependencies, allowing it to run in any environment, including on-premise, cloud, and IoT devices. It is a lightweight workflow engine that meets enterprise requirements.

Note: For a list of features, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.dagu.cloud/features/).

Workflow jobs are defined as commands. Therefore, legacy scripts that have been in operation for a long time within a company or organization can be used as-is without modification. There is no need to learn a complex new language, and you can start using it right away.

Dagu is designed for enterprise & small teams to easily manage complex workflows. It aims to be an ideal choice for teams that find large-scale, high-cost infrastructure like Airflow to be overkill and are looking for a simpler solution. It requires no database management and only needs a shared filesystem, allowing you to focus on your high-value work.

## Use Cases

Dagu is designed to orchestrate workflows across various domains, particularly those involving multi-step batch jobs and complex data dependencies. Example applications include:

* AI/ML & Data Science - Automating machine learning workflows, including data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, validation, and deployment.
* Geospatial & Environmental Analysis - Processing datasets from sources such as satellites (earth observation), aerial/terrestrial sensors, seismic surveys, and ground-based radar. Common uses include numerical weather prediction and natural resource management.
* Finance & Trading - Implementing time-sensitive workflows for stock market analysis, quantitative modeling, risk assessment, and report generation.
* Medical Imaging & Bioinformatics - Creating pipelines to process and analyze large volumes of medical scans (e.g., MRI, CT) or genomic data for clinical and research purposes.
* Data Engineering (ETL/ELT) - Building, scheduling, and monitoring pipelines for moving and transforming data between systems like databases, data warehouses, and data lakes.
* IoT & Edge Computing - Orchestrating workflows that collect, process, and analyze data from distributed IoT devices, sensors, and edge nodes.
* Media & Content Processing - Automating workflows for video transcoding, image processing, and content delivery, including tasks like format conversion, compression, and metadata extraction.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dagu

**npm**:
```bash
# Install via npm
npm install -g dagu
```

**Homebrew**:

```bash
brew install dagu-org/brew/dagu

# Upgrade to latest version
brew upgrade dagu-org/brew/dagu
```

**macOS/Linux**:

```bash
# Install via script
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagu-org/dagu/main/scripts/installer.sh | bash
```

**Docker**:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v ~/.dagu:/var/lib/dagu \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  ghcr.io/dagu-org/dagu:latest \
  dagu start-all
```

Note: see [documentation](https://docs.dagu.cloud/getting-started/installation) for other methods.

### 2. Create your first workflow

```bash
cat > ./hello.yaml << 'EOF'
steps:
  - name: hello
    command: echo "Hello from Dagu!"
  - name: world  
    command: echo "Running step 2"
EOF
```

### 3. Run the workflow

```bash
dagu start hello.yaml
```

### 4. Check the status and view logs

```bash
dagu status hello
```

### 5. Explore the Web UI

```bash
dagu start-all
```

Visit http://localhost:8080
