const defaultBaseConfig = `# Base DAG Configuration
# =====================
# Values defined here are inherited by ALL DAGs.
# Individual DAGs can override any setting.
# Environment variables (env:) are additive — DAG env vars append to these.
#
# Settings with sensible defaults are enabled below. Uncomment others as needed.

# -- Active Defaults --

# Execution model. Keep the default explicit so new base.yaml files are self-describing.
# "chain" runs steps sequentially in definition order.
# "graph" runs steps in parallel based on dependency resolution.
type: chain

# Behavior when a new run is triggered while one is already active.
# "skip" = discard the new run. "all" = queue all runs. "latest" = keep only the most recent.
overlap_policy: skip

# Log file format. "separate" writes stdout to .out and stderr to .err files.
# "merged" combines both into a single .log file.
log_output: separate

# Number of days to retain DAG run history before automatic purge.
hist_retention_days: 30

# Maximum seconds to wait for step cleanup when a DAG is stopped.
max_clean_up_time_sec: 5

# Maximum number of steps that can run concurrently within a single DAG execution.
# 0 = unlimited. Only applies when type is "graph".
max_active_steps: 10

# Maximum bytes of stdout/stderr output captured per step. Excess output is truncated.
max_output_size: 1048576  # 1MB (bytes)

# Lookback window for replaying missed scheduled runs after downtime.
# On scheduler restart, all missed cron intervals within this window are executed (max 1000).
# Duration string: e.g. "6h", "24h", "2d12h". Empty = no catchup (missed runs discarded).
catchup_window: "6h"

# Retry the entire DAG after a terminal failure.
# This absorbs transient infrastructure or dependency failures by default.
# Override or disable per DAG if the workflow is intentionally non-idempotent.
retry_policy:
  limit: 3
  interval_sec: 5

# -- Shell --
# Shell interpreter for command steps.
# Default resolution order: $DAGU_DEFAULT_SHELL -> $SHELL -> sh
# Can be a string (split on spaces) or an explicit array.
# shell: "bash -e"
# shell: ["/bin/bash", "-e"]

# -- Working Directory --
# Default working directory for all steps. Supports ~ (home), $ENV_VAR, and
# relative paths (resolved against DAG file location). Default: DAG file's parent directory.
# working_dir: /home/user/workflows

# -- Dotenv --
# Load environment variables from files before execution.
# Accepts a single path or an array. Later files override earlier ones.
# Paths are resolved relative to working_dir.
# dotenv: .env
# dotenv:
#   - .env
#   - .env.local

# -- Timeout & Delays --
# timeout_sec: Max execution time for the entire DAG in seconds. 0 = no timeout.
# delay_sec: Seconds to sleep before starting the first step. 0 = start immediately.
# restart_wait_sec: Seconds to wait before restart (dagu restart command). 0 = no wait.
# timeout_sec: 3600
# delay_sec: 0
# restart_wait_sec: 0

# -- Logging --
# Directory for log files. Default: $XDG_DATA_HOME/dagu/logs or $DAGU_HOME/logs
# log_dir: /var/log/dagu

# -- Queue --
# Assign DAGs to a named queue for concurrency control across DAGs.
# When unset, each DAG uses its own name as the process group (no cross-DAG coordination).
# queue: default

# -- Environment Variables --
# Global env vars inherited by all DAGs. DAG-level env vars are appended (not replaced).
# env:
#   - LOG_LEVEL: "info"
#   - ENVIRONMENT: "production"

# -- Step Defaults --
# Applied to every step unless the step overrides a field explicitly.
# defaults:
#
#   # Retry on failure. limit = max retries. interval_sec = wait between retries.
#   # backoff = exponential multiplier (next_interval = interval_sec * backoff^attempt).
#   # max_interval_sec = cap on computed interval. exit_code = retry only on these codes.

#     max_interval_sec: 60
#     exit_code: [1, 2]
#
#   # Continue to next step instead of failing the DAG.
#   # failure = on any failure. skipped = when preconditions not met.
#   # exit_code = continue only on these exit codes. output = continue on matching stdout patterns.
#   # mark_success = treat the step as succeeded when continue_on triggers.
#   continue_on:
#     failure: false
#     skipped: false
#     exit_code: []
#     output: []
#     mark_success: false
#
#   # Repeat a step in a loop.
#   # repeat: "while" (repeat while condition matches) or "until" (repeat until it matches).
#   # condition = command to evaluate. expected = stdout value to compare against.
#   repeat_policy:
#     repeat: "while"
#     interval_sec: 5
#     limit: 10
#     condition: "curl -s http://localhost:8080/health"

#
#   # Per-step timeout in seconds. Overrides DAG-level timeout_sec for this step.
#   timeout_sec: 300
#
#   # Signal sent to the step process when the DAG is stopped. e.g. SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGKILL.
#   signal_on_stop: "SIGTERM"
#
#   # Send error_mail when this step fails.
#   mail_on_error: true

# -- Lifecycle Handlers --
# Hooks that run on DAG events. Each handler is a full step definition (supports command,
# shell, env, timeout_sec, etc. — not limited to a simple command string).

# success: Runs when DAG completes successfully.
# failure: Runs when DAG fails.
# abort:   Runs when DAG is cancelled.
# exit:    Runs on any exit (success, failure, or abort).
# wait:    Runs when DAG enters wait status (human-in-the-loop approval).
#
# handler_on:
#   init:
#     command: echo "DAG starting"
