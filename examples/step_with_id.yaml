# Example DAG showing the use of step IDs
# Step IDs provide a stable identifier for steps that persists even if step names change
name: step-id-example

steps:
  # Step with both name and ID
  - name: fetch-data
    id: data-fetcher-v1
    command: echo "Fetching data from API..."
    
  # Step without ID (just name)
  - name: validate-data
    command: echo "Validating fetched data..."
    depends: fetch-data
    
  # Step with ID for stable references
  - name: process-data
    id: processor-v2
    command: echo "Processing validated data..."
    depends: validate-data
    
  # Step that depends on a step by name
  - name: store-results
    command: echo "Storing processed results..."
    depends: process-data
