description: Example DAG demonstrating worker label selectors

# This DAG shows how to use workerSelector to route tasks
# to specific workers based on their capabilities

steps:
  # Task requiring GPU for ML model training
  - name: train-model
    command: python train_model.py --dataset large
    workerSelector:
      gpu: "true"
      memory: "64G"
    description: "Trains ML model on GPU-enabled worker with 64GB memory"

  # Data preprocessing on CPU-optimized worker
  - name: preprocess-data
    command: python preprocess.py --input raw_data.csv
    workerSelector:
      cpu-arch: "amd64"
      cpu-cores: "16"
    depends: []
    description: "Preprocesses data on CPU-optimized worker"

  # Region-specific task for compliance
  - name: process-eu-data
    command: ./process_gdpr_data.sh
    workerSelector:
      region: "eu-west-1"
      compliance: "gdpr"
    description: "Processes EU data on GDPR-compliant worker in EU region"

  # High-memory task for large dataset analysis
  - name: analyze-large-dataset
    command: spark-submit --class DataAnalysis analysis.jar
    workerSelector:
      memory: "128G"
      instance-type: "r5.4xlarge"
    depends:
      - preprocess-data
    description: "Analyzes large dataset on high-memory worker"

  # Generic task that can run on any worker
  - name: send-notifications
    command: python notify.py --status complete
    # No workerSelector - runs on any available worker
    depends:
      - train-model
      - analyze-large-dataset
    description: "Sends completion notifications (runs on any worker)"
# Example worker startup commands:
#
# GPU worker:
#   dagu worker --worker.labels gpu=true,memory=64G,region=us-east-1
#
# CPU-optimized worker:
#   dagu worker --worker.labels cpu-arch=amd64,cpu-cores=16,region=us-west-2
#
# EU compliance worker:
#   dagu worker --worker.labels region=eu-west-1,compliance=gdpr
#
# High-memory worker:
#   dagu worker --worker.labels memory=128G,instance-type=r5.4xlarge
#
# Configuration file example:
# worker:
#   labels:
#     gpu: "true"
#     memory: "64G"
#     region: "us-east-1"
