# Spec: Harness Executor

## Status

Partially implemented.

## Scope

Unlike specs 060-066, `harness` is a built-in Go executor, not a remote
action: it ships in the `dagu` binary and never reaches the network to
resolve itself. Its purpose is to run a third-party AI coding agent CLI
(for example `claude`, `codex`, `aider`, `cursor`, or a custom CLI) as a
subprocess, feeding it a prompt and capturing its output like an ordinary
command step.

This spec covers:

- the `action: harness.run` step shape: `with.prompt` (required, becomes
  the step's command/prompt text), `with.stdin` (optional, piped to the
  process's stdin), `with.provider` (required, selects a built-in CLI
  provider or a custom `harnesses:` entry), and `with.fallback` (an
  ordered list of alternative provider configs tried after the primary
  fails)
- any other `with:` key becomes a CLI flag passed to the provider's
  binary: a boolean `true` becomes a bare flag, a string or number becomes
  `--key value`, and an array repeats `--key` once per element
- the top-level `harnesses:` block, which defines a named, reusable custom
  provider (`binary`, `prefix_args`, `prompt_mode`, `prompt_flag`,
  `prompt_position`, `flag_style`, `option_flags`) that a step selects via
  `with.provider`, for a CLI the built-in provider catalog does not name
- capturing stdout through a declared `output: NAME` and reading it in a
  downstream step ([Spec 012: Step Outputs](012-step-outputs.md))
- that, unlike the remote actions in specs 060-066, `dagu validate` fully
  resolves and checks a harness step's provider configuration and any
  `harnesses:` definitions it references, since both are local to the DAG
  file and this binary -- the one thing it cannot check is whether the
  configured binary actually exists, since that is a real filesystem/PATH
  lookup deferred to run time
- fallback behavior: when the primary provider's process exits non-zero,
  the step retries with the next entry in `with.fallback`, in order, until
  one succeeds or the list is exhausted; a message naming both providers is
  written to the step's stderr before each retry

This spec also covers the configuration and dispatch failures of
containerized harness execution (a step-level `container:` block on a
`harness.run` step) that are reachable without a working container daemon
or a pulled image -- neither guaranteed in every environment this suite
runs in, so a step's *successful* containerized execution is not itself
covered here.

This spec does not define:

- the behavior of any specific built-in CLI provider (`claude`, `codex`,
  `aider`, and so on) -- none is installed in this conformance
  environment, so this spec exercises only custom `harnesses:` providers,
  which share the same invocation-building and fallback code paths
- a containerized harness step's successful execution (the actual agent CLI
  running inside a real container and producing output), the managed
  OpenCode execution path's successful session, or `type: agent` DAGs' own
  use of a harness step as one of several actions in a decision loop
  ([Spec 032: Agent DAGs](032-agent-dag.md))
- prompt engineering, model behavior, or the semantics of any particular
  agent CLI's own flags

## Goal

Workflow authors give an AI coding agent CLI a task and capture its output
as an ordinary Dagu step, whether that CLI is one of the built-in provider
names or an arbitrary custom CLI wired in through `harnesses:`.

## Behavior

### Step shape and invocation building

A harness step is written `action: harness.run` with `with.prompt`
required; `with.prompt` becomes the step's command text (equivalent to a
`run:` step's command), and `with.stdin`, when set, is piped to the
process's stdin as a separate script body. `with.provider` selects either
a built-in CLI provider name or a name defined under the DAG's top-level
`harnesses:` block; an unknown name fails with `unknown provider`.

For a custom (`harnesses:`-defined) provider, the invocation is built as:

1. `prefix_args`, if any.
2. The prompt and the flags built from the step's other `with:` keys, in
   the order `prompt_position` says (`before_flags`, the default, or
   `after_flags`), with the prompt delivered according to `prompt_mode`:
   - `arg`: the prompt is a bare positional argument.
   - `flag`: the prompt follows `prompt_flag` (required only for this
     mode; setting it for any other mode is itself an error).
   - `stdin`: no prompt argument at all; the prompt and `with.stdin` are
     joined with a blank line (either half omitted if empty) and both
     piped to the process's stdin instead.
3. `with.stdin`, when set and `prompt_mode` is not `stdin`, is still piped
   to the process's stdin as a separate stream from the argument-delivered
   prompt.

The input keys `prompt` and `stdin`, and executor options `provider`,
`fallback`, and `managed`, do not become CLI flags. Other keys are sorted
by key for deterministic ordering. Each key becomes `--key` (or `-key`
when the definition's `flag_style` is `single_dash`) unless
`option_flags` maps that key to a different literal flag token. A boolean
`true` value produces the bare flag with no value (`false` is omitted
entirely); a string, integer, or float value produces `flag value`; an
array value repeats `flag value` once per element.

### Containerized execution

A step-level `container:` block runs the resolved provider's binary inside
an image-created container, using that binary as its entrypoint.
`dagu validate` checks the general harness configuration. The following
container-specific restrictions are checked at runtime:

- `prompt_mode: stdin` fails with `harness: containerized harness does not
  support stdin input`.
- `container.name` is rejected for image-mode harness steps. Running inside
  an existing container uses `container.exec`.
- `provider: opencode` with `managed: true` fails with `harness: managed
  OpenCode is not supported inside containers`.

### Fallback

`with.fallback` is an array of provider configs (each shaped like the
step's own `provider` plus flags), tried in order after the primary
config's process exits non-zero. Before each retry, the step's stderr
receives a line naming both the failed and the next provider (`harness:
attempt <n>/<total> with <name> failed; trying fallback <n+1>/<total> with
<name>`). The step succeeds as a whole the moment any config succeeds, and
that config's stdout becomes the step's stdout; each earlier attempt's own
stderr remains part of the step's stderr. If every config fails, the step
fails with the last config's own error.

### Result

A harness step captures the provider process's stdout and stderr. A declared
`output: NAME` makes stdout available to downstream steps, following
[Spec 012: Step Outputs](012-step-outputs.md).

## Errors

### Validation

`dagu validate` resolves a harness step's provider configuration and any
`harnesses:` definitions fully -- both are local to the DAG file and this
binary, unlike a remote action's schema. It checks:

- `with.prompt` missing: `with.prompt is required`.
- `with.provider` missing, or naming neither a built-in provider nor a
  defined `harnesses:` entry: `config.provider is required` or `unknown
  provider "<name>"`.
- `with.binary` or `with.prompt_args` present: both are rejected outright
  (`config.binary is not supported...` / `config.prompt_args is not
  supported...`) -- a custom CLI must be defined under `harnesses:` and
  selected via `with.provider`, not configured inline on the step.
- A `harnesses:` entry missing `binary`: `binary is required`.
- A `harnesses:` entry's `prompt_mode` not one of `arg`, `flag`, `stdin`:
  `prompt_mode must be one of: arg, flag, stdin`.
- A `harnesses:` entry's `prompt_flag` set when `prompt_mode` is not
  `flag`, or unset when it is: `prompt_flag is only valid when prompt_mode
  is flag` / `prompt_flag is required when prompt_mode is flag`.

`dagu validate` does not check whether the configured binary actually
exists on disk or in `PATH` -- that is deferred to run time.

### Runtime

- The configured binary cannot be resolved (it does not exist, or is not
  on `PATH`): the step fails with `harness: failed to resolve binary
  "<name>": ...` before any process starts.
- The provider's process exits non-zero, with no `with.fallback`
  configured (or every fallback also fails): the step fails with that
  process's own real exit code, and its own stdout/stderr are captured as
  usual -- this is a real process failure, not a wrapper-level validation
  error.
- A containerized step (`container:` set) whose provider's `prompt_mode` is
  `stdin`, whose `container.name` is set (image mode), or whose
  `provider: opencode` step sets `managed: true`: each fails as described
  above in Containerized execution, before any container daemon is
  contacted.
- A containerized step whose configured container daemon cannot be reached
  (wrong socket, daemon not running): the step fails with `harness: failed
  to initialize container client: ...`.

## Examples

Define a custom CLI provider and use it with structured flags:

```yaml
harnesses:
  my_agent:
    binary: /usr/local/bin/my-agent
    prompt_mode: flag
    prompt_flag: --task
    option_flags:
      max_turns: --turns

steps:
  - id: review
    action: harness.run
    with:
      provider: my_agent
      prompt: Review this patch for correctness.
      stdin: |
        diff --git a/main.go b/main.go
        ...
      max_turns: 3
    output: REVIEW_RESULT

  - id: print
    depends: review
    run: echo "${REVIEW_RESULT}"
```

Fall back to a second provider if the first fails:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: fix
    action: harness.run
    with:
      provider: claude
      prompt: Fix the failing test.
      fallback:
        - provider: codex
```
