# Spec: File Dependencies

## Status

Implemented.

## Scope

This spec defines:

- the step-level `dependencies` field
- dependency path matching and validation
- local and distributed workspace snapshot and materialization behavior
- retry and inline child-DAG behavior
- coordinator-owned snapshots for separately fetched named child DAGs

This spec does not define:

- external tool installation
- build-workflow input materialization or reuse
- artifact persistence after a DAG-run finishes

## Goal

A DAG can use declared files from its working directory with the same isolated workspace behavior in local and distributed execution.

## Behavior

### Declaration

- A step may declare `dependencies` as one string or an array of strings.
- Each string must be literal and must not contain a Dagu value reference.
- Declarations on regular steps, lifecycle handlers, foreach body steps, and every inline DAG document contribute to one snapshot for the dispatched DAG-run.

### Matching

- Paths resolve relative to the DAG working directory. When `working_dir` is omitted, the authored DAG file's directory is the source root.
- An exact regular file selects that file.
- An exact directory selects the directory and its descendants recursively.
- A glob may use `*`, `?`, character classes, and `**`.
- Overlapping selections include each filesystem entry once.
- Every declaration must match at least one filesystem entry when the run workspace is prepared.
- Absolute paths, parent traversal, `.git` paths, symlinks, special files, and invalid glob patterns are invalid.

### Workspace execution

- A local or distributed start or retry snapshots the current matching entries before execution.
- The snapshot contains the exact DAG definition carried by the dispatched task.
- Local execution materializes the snapshot directly. Distributed execution transports the immutable content-addressed bundle through the coordinator before the worker materializes it.
- The snapshot is materialized as `DAG_RUN_WORK_DIR` and `${context.paths.work_dir}` before execution.
- The materialized directory is the process working directory for the DAG. An explicit step working directory retains its normal precedence.
- The bundle must not exceed 64 MiB compressed, 256 MiB extracted, or 8192 entries.

### Child DAGs and retries

- Inline multi-document child DAGs reuse the root DAG's snapshot.
- A separately fetched named child DAG creates an independent snapshot from its authoritative source workspace and does not inherit its parent's snapshot.
- When the dispatching host cannot access that source workspace, the coordinator verifies that the fetched definition still matches the authoritative stored DAG before creating the snapshot. If the definition changed, dispatch fails so the caller can reload and retry.
- Each independently executed retry creates a fresh snapshot from the DAG working directory.

## Errors

| Failure class | Required diagnostic |
| --- | --- |
| Value reference in a dependency | validation error naming `dependencies` |
| Invalid or unsafe path | workspace preparation fails with the dependency path and reason |
| Declaration with no match | workspace preparation fails naming the unmatched declaration |
| Unsupported filesystem entry | workspace preparation fails naming the entry type and path |
| Bundle limit exceeded | workspace preparation fails naming the exceeded limit |
| Named child changed after remote resolution | dispatch fails and instructs the caller to reload and retry |
| Authoritative named-child source unavailable | dispatch fails before worker execution |
| Worker download, verification, or extraction failure | DAG-run fails before step execution |

## Examples

```yaml
steps:
  - id: backup
    run: ./scripts/backup.sh --config config/app.yaml
    dependencies:
      - scripts/**
      - config/app.yaml
```

```yaml
steps:
  - id: import
    run: python scripts/import.py
    dependencies: scripts/import.py
```
