# File Dependencies

Use step-level `dependencies` when a DAG run needs files from its working directory.

```yaml
steps:
  - id: process
    run: ./scripts/process.sh --config config/app.yaml
    dependencies:
      - scripts/**
      - config/app.yaml
```

The field accepts one string or an array. Each item is a literal path relative to the DAG working directory and may be an exact file, a recursively included directory, or a glob using `*`, `?`, character classes, or `**`. When `working_dir` is omitted, the authored DAG file's directory is the source root.

Every item must match when the run workspace is prepared. Do not use `${...}` references, absolute paths, parent traversal, `.git` paths, symlinks, or special files. All dependencies in the root DAG, lifecycle handlers, foreach bodies, and inline DAG documents share one bundle.

Local execution materializes the bundle directly; distributed execution transfers it through the coordinator before worker materialization. The result is exposed as `DAG_RUN_WORK_DIR` and `${context.paths.work_dir}` and becomes the DAG process working directory. An explicit step working directory retains its normal precedence.

Retries create a new snapshot. Inline multi-document child DAGs reuse their parent's snapshot, while separately fetched named child DAGs create an independent snapshot from their authoritative source workspace. In shared-nothing distributed execution, the coordinator packages the named child's declared files before dispatch. If the named DAG changed after the worker fetched it, dispatch fails and instructs the caller to reload and retry.
